# Run MATLAB Tests on Jenkins Server

This example shows how to run a suite of MATLAB&reg; unit tests with Jenkins&trade;. The example demonstrates how to:

* Configure Jenkins to run a freestyle project including MATLAB tests.
* Interface Jenkins with a remote repository that contains the tests.
* Build the freestyle project and examine the generated artifacts.

The freestyle project runs the tests in the Times Table App MATLAB project (which requires R2019a or later). You can create a working copy of the project files and open the project in MATLAB by running this statement in the Command Window.

```
matlab.project.example.timesTable
```

For more information about the Times Table App example project, see [Explore an Example Project](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/explore-an-example-project.html).

## Prerequisites
Running the tests in this example requires you to interface Jenkins with MATLAB as well as a remote repository.

* To run MATLAB tests and generate artifacts, you must install the plugin for MATLAB. For information on how to install a plugin in Jenkins, see [Managing Plugins](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/).
* Jenkins runs the tests in a branch of the remote repository that is specified by a URL. To follow the build steps in this example, the Times Table App project must be under Git&trade; source control. For example, you can create a new repository for the project using your GitHub&reg; account. For more information, see [Use Source Control with Projects](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/use-source-control-with-projects.html).
* To publish the artifacts using post-build actions, relevant plugins must be installed on Jenkins. For example, the [Cobertura plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cobertura) integrates Cobertura coverage reports to Jenkins, and [JUnit plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit) publishes JUnit-style test results. 

## Configure Jenkins Project to Run MATLAB Tests
Create a new project and configure it by following these steps:
1. In your Jenkins interface, select **New Item** on the left. A new page opens where you can choose the type of your project. Enter a project name, then click **Freestyle project**. To confirm your choices, click **OK**.

2. In the configuration window of your Jenkins project, navigate to the **Source Code Management** section and click **Git**. This option enables Jenkins to interface with a remote repository.

3. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub repository that hosts your tests. Click **Code** and copy the web URL to your clipboard.

4. In the project configuration window, paste the URL into the **Repository URL** box of the **Source Code Management** section. You also can specify the branch to build in the **Branch Specifier** box.

![source_control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/94478391-37a73700-01a1-11eb-9f89-a5a71413baf0.png)


5. In the **Build Environment** section, select **Use MATLAB version** and specify the MATLAB version you want to use in the build. If your desired MATLAB version is not listed under **Use MATLAB version**, enter the full path to its root folder in the **MATLAB root** box. 

![build_environment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105091260-943ea280-5a6d-11eb-8d11-48747df7ec32.png)

6. In the **Build** section, select **Add build step > Run MATLAB Tests**. Then, select your desired artifacts to be generated in the project workspace. The plugin in this example is configured to generate Cobertura code coverage and JUnit-style test results reports. Furthermore, the coverage report is generated only for the code in the `source` folder located in the root of your repository. For more information on how to configure the plugin, see [Plugin Configuration Guide](../CONFIGDOC.md).

7. In the **Post-build Actions** section, add two post-build actions to publish the Cobertura code coverage and JUnit-style test results reports. For each report, provide the path to the report file.

![post_build](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105082096-14aad680-5a61-11eb-9868-68d018199f9d.png)

8. Click **Save** to save the project configuration settings. You can access and modify your settings at a later stage by selecting **Configure** in the project interface.

## Run Tests and Inspect Artifacts
To build your freestyle project, click **Build Now** in the project interface, which displays the project name at the top-left of the page. Jenkins triggers a build, assigns it a number under **Build History**, and runs the build. If the build is successful, a blue circle icon appears next to the build number. If the build fails, Jenkins adds a red circle icon. In this example, the build passes because all of the tests in the Times Table App project pass.

![build_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105084788-dca59280-5a64-11eb-858d-664a5727a947.png)

Navigate to the project workspace by clicking the **Workspace** icon in the project interface. In this example, the generated artifacts are in the `matlabTestArtifacts` folder of the workspace.

![workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105085419-b46a6380-5a65-11eb-8d46-747dd23291bf.png)

Access the published Cobertura code coverage report by opening the **Coverage Report** link in the project interface.

![cobertura_report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105085331-9ac91c00-5a65-11eb-9628-efbf70520489.png)

To view the published JUnit-style test results, open the **Latest Test Result** link in the project interface. In the new page, open the link in the **All Tests** table. The table expands and lists information for each of the test classes within the Times Table App project.  

![junit_report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48831250/105088211-956dd080-5a69-11eb-931c-aef201eb9dbe.png)
